Coordination between the OpenLibrary.org Librarian community

The purpose of this repository is to track and manage Open Library issues that require human review. Issues that should or can be solved programatically are out of the scope of this repository and should be posted to the [primary Open Library repository](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary). 

Types of issues appropriate for this repository include, but are not limited to, duplicate and conflated records, review of low-quality data, and review of questionable, inappropriate, or spammy edits.
